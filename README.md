# Docker development setup

1) Install Docker.app

2) gem install stack_car

3) We recommend committing .env to your repo with good defaults. .env.development, .env.production etc can be used for local overrides and should not be in the repo.

4) sc up

When creating a new instance of REU:
create a new branch that will be the 'master' of the new app
docker-compose build
sc up
docker-compose exec web bash
rake db:create db:migrate
rake db:seed settings:load
```

# Deploy a new release

``` bash
sc release {staging | production} # creates and pushes the correct tags

```

Releaese and Deployment are handled by the gitlab ci by default. See ops/deploy-app to deploy from locally, but note all Rancher install pull the currently tagged registry image

## Info
This program facilitates the application process for science oriented [NSF REU programs](http://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/) and is developed by the IT staff of the [UC San Diego Institute of Engineering in Medicine](https://iem.ucsd.edu/).

[REU Manager](https://reumanager.com) is built with [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and is completely free to host/maintain yourself.   You can see a demonstration of the site at: https://reumanager.com/new_demo .  You may login as the administrative user with the email admin@reumanager.com and the password DemoApp.

Below are instructions for those who wish to install and maintain the application using their own equipment.
